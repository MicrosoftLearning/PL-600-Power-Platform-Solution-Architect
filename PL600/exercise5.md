# Power Apps Architecture

## Task 1: Identify where Power Apps Component Framework (PCF) might be helpful.

**Approach:**

- **Visitor Check-In Interface**: Use PCF to create a custom QR code scanner for quick visitor check-ins.
- **Visitor Schedule View**: Build a PCF component for a dynamic calendar view that security staff can use to see visitor schedules by day or building.
- **Swipe Card System Integration**: Develop a PCF component to handle limited access data extraction from the swipe card system.

## Task 2: Plan to support multiple app makers building the app.

**Approach:**

- **Environment Configuration**:
  - Set up a **managed solution environment** in Power Platform.
  - Use **Dataverse** to centralize all entities and relationships.
- **Collaboration Tools**:
  - Use **Microsoft Teams** for communication.
  - Enable **co-authoring** via Power Apps Maker portal.
- **Version Control**:
  - Integrate **Azure DevOps** pipelines for Application Lifecycle Management (ALM).
  - Create branches for each app maker and enforce pull request reviews.

## Task 3: Consider app type for each use case.

**Approach:**

- **Canvas Apps**:
  - For tablet-based check-in/out at building entrances.
  - For visitor parking booking with a dynamic interface to display availability.
- **Model-Driven Apps**:
  - For managing building access and scheduling inspections.
  - For security managers to view visitor volumes and employee visit booking data.
- **Portals (Power Pages)**:
  - For visitors to access visit details and enter parking information.
- **Power Automate**:
  - Automate parking availability checks and updates.

## Task 4: How to handle integration with legacy systems like swipe card access.

**Approach:**

- Develop a **custom connector** for the dedicated computer running the swipe card system.
- Automate data updates from Dataverse to the system using Power Automate.
- Leverage **Azure Logic Apps** if complex integration workflows are required.

---

## Task 5: Ensure security and scalability of the system.

**Approach:**

- Implement **Azure AD B2C** for visitor authentication and role-based access.
- Use **Dataverse capacity planning** to manage data storage and optimize performance.
- Enable **incremental deployment** using solution layers for scaling as new functionalities are added.
